* Elasticsearch can help you solve many problems right out of the box

* There will be times, however, when you will need to write a script as part of the solution

** For example, you may want to modify the way in which documents are scored in a full-text search

** Or you may want to calculate the duration of a trip and store it in a new field

** Or you may want to use an advanced optimization algorithm to find the best route for a package delivery driver

* In such cases, you will need to use Elasticsearchâ€™s Painless scripting language
