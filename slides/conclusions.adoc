* In this course, you learned to write scripts that will help you solve a wide variety of complex data processing problems

* We explored the syntax and basics of Painless scripting

* We developed simple scripts that process index data during Elasticsearch operations, such as search and update — use them as starting points for your own scripts!

* We learned to work with numbers, strings and dates — types commonly used in Elasticsearch indices

* Finally, we solved and analyzed iteratively a complete problem using the skills you learned

* Stay tuned for other courses on Painless

== Lesson 1

. *False*

. Fast, secure, supports all Java data types, exposes many Java API’s, Groovy-like syntax

. *False*

. *True*

. *False*. `while` evaluates the condition at the beginning of the block and `do-while` evaluates it at the end (so it executes the block at least once)

== Lesson 2

. *True*

. `params[‘_source’]`

. *True*

. *False*. Script-generated values can be used in the sort clause in combination with any other values (from other scripts or from fields)

== Lesson 3

. *False*. Operations such as `Math.random()` or `Math.sin()` are readily available to Painless scripts, as well as many other Java API’s

. `+` (or `concat`), `length`, `toLowerCase`, `substring`

. *False*. `ZonedDateTime.parse(s)` will convert a string `s` containing a date into a `ZonedDateTime` object

. `Duration`, `Period`, `ChronoUnit`

== Lesson 4
image::white-background.png[background, size=cover]

. *False*. If possible, a script should be run as few times as possible, e.g., ingest time vs. query time

. Painless can use Java API’s to parse custom formats and convert them to a `ZonedDatetime`

. *True*

. The settings of an index can be used to define a default pipeline

. *False*. The logic of the solution was encapsulated in functions which were independent of the Painless context in use during execution
